# yanplaRoles
`yanplaRoles` is a mod for the game Among Us that introduces new roles and modifiers, currently there are the Jester, Executioner, Snitch and Sheriff roles, and the Captain Modifier.

### Jester

The Jester is a neutral role that wins the game if they are voted out (exiled) by the other players.

### Executioner

The Executioner is a neutral role that wins the game if their target is voted out (exiled) by the other players. (If the Executioner's target dies before they get exiled, the executioner becomes a crewmate.)

### Sheriff

The Sheriff is a crewmate role that can kill Impostors. However, if the Sheriff kills a Crewmate, the Sheriff dies instead.

### Snitch

The Snitch is a crewmate role. If the snitch completes all their tasks, the Impostors's names will turn red for them.

### Captain

The Captain is a modifier that grants the ability to call an emergency meeting from anywhere on the map, without needing to be at the emergency button.
